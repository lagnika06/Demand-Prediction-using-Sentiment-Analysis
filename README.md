📌 Demand Prediction using Sentiment Analysis 🚀
🔍 Predicting product demand based on Amazon reviews and ratings!

📖 Overview
This project leverages sentiment analysis and machine learning to predict the demand for Amazon products based on customer reviews and ratings. By analyzing sentiment scores and review metadata, we estimate future product demand trends.

⚡ Key Features
✅ Sentiment Analysis: Classifies reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.
✅ Demand Prediction: Uses sentiment scores and rating counts to predict demand.
✅ Data Augmentation: Generates synthetic reviews for better model generalization.
✅ Deep Learning Approach: Implements LSTM with GloVe embeddings for NLP.
✅ Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful insights from product metadata.

📂 Dataset
Amazon product reviews, including:
Reviews: Title, content, sentiment
Product details: Ratings, price, discount, category
User interactions: Review count, engagement
🛠 Technologies Used
